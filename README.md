# Video Livestreaming Test

I was trying to test how I could record video, use FFMPEG to format the video data into streamable bytes which I can then stream over TCP or UDP, to then be able to play it back on another machine...
But then I realized I don't have the energy to continue beyond writing the boiletplate...
